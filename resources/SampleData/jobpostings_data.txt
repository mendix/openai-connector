    "Description": "Description About us Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed. We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas. Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you. Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Life at Builder It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude. Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild",

The Role: Software Engineer (Senior) As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be working on various products that make up our technology stack, which includes (but is not limited to): TypeDB Core: is a polymorphic database with a conceptual data model, a strong subtyping system, a symbolic reasoning engine, and a beautiful and elegant type-theoretic language: TypeQL. TypeDB is built with open-source distributed technology stacks: SpeeDB, ANTLR, SCIP, Bazel, and GRPC. Today, TypeDB is written in Java, but we are in the process of rewriting it in Rust, with clients implemented in multiple languages, such as Java, Python, and Node.js. The extensive build system of TypeDB is built with Kotlin and Bazel. TypeDB Enterprise: the distributed version of TypeDB, using the same open-source distributed technologies (plus ZeroMQ), built through a reactive architecture implementing the Raft replication algorithms. TypeDB Cluster serves as our commercial offering that provides TypeDB users with scalability, security, configurability and management tools to effectively use TypeDB in a production environment. Today, TypeDB Cluster is written in Java, but we're now rewriting it in Rust. The extensive build system is also built with Kotlin and Bazel. TypeDB Cloud: the cloud platform in which TypeDB will be automatically deployed, managed, and orchestrated in any of the popular cloud services: GCP, AWS, or Azure. Similar to Vaticle Factory, Vaticle Cloud is built in the cloud, using the Kubernetes technology stack. Vaticle Cloud is also built in Rust, Angular, and TypeScript. TypeDB Studio: the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of TypeDB. Studio allows developers to manage their TypeDB project source code (e.g. schema and data), interactively manage the database schema, data and users, as well as query the database to produce graph visualizations of their data. Studio is built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. FactoryCI: the in-house built CI platform that automates our entire software development life cycle from testing, benchmarking, tracing, quality checking, dependency upgrading, verifying (releases), and releasing. Vaticle Factory is designed for engineering teams building distributed systems on multi-repo architectures that require performance benchmarking. Vaticle Factory is built in the cloud, using the Kubernetes technology stack. Today, Vaticle Factory is written in Java and React, but we're now rewriting it in Rust, Angular, and TypeScript. Across all technologies, your primary languages for development will be Rust, Kotlin, and TypeScript. As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be assigned to one technology at a time from the list above, rotating to various other projects over time, to acquire the skills and experience to grow as a Software Engineer, and impact various technologies in the company. Each assignment from will be decided based your interest, skillset, experience, and the team development needs at the time. Your work will span across all aspects of software engineering; from programming and debugging, to architecture design, build engineering, release engineering, documentation, workflow automation, code reviews, as well as R&D. As a senior engineer, you will have a lot of opportunity to lead the growth of the company, if you prefer to take on the role of technical leadership. Culture You will be joining a team that cares deeply not just about the intelligence of the technology, but also the elegance and simplicity of the solution. We have a strong sense of urgency, but we always care about \"why\" something needs to be developed, and we make sure that we work purposefully. Although we are expected to be independent in delivering our responsibilities, we collaborate in perfecting our ideas and solutions.

We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas. Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you. Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Life at Builder It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude. Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild",

    "Description": "Description About us Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed. We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas. Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you. Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Life at Builder It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude. Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild",
